This is an AI-powered educational web application built using Flask that assists students in learning core computer science subjects like FLAT (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms), and Aptitude. The platform integrates LLM-powered Q&A (via Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3) with vector-based semantic retrieval using Pinecone and HuggingFace embeddings.

Key features include:

Subject-specific AI Q&A using context-aware document retrieval

Dynamic quiz generation based on student interactions

Transition diagram visualization for automata theory

Article summarization using natural language processing

Session-based conversation tracking for personalized learning

This project combines the power of modern LLMs with traditional CS concepts to create an interactive, intelligent learning tool.
